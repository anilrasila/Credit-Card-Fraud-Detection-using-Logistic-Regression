# Logistic-Regression
This repository contain Logistic Regression machine learning algorithm
We have built a Credit card Fraud Detection system using Machine Learning with Python. For this project, we have used the Logistic Regression model.

Steps in Logistic Regression:

Step 1: First of all we have a dummy dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
Step 2: Then load the dataset to the pandas dataframe in jupyter notebook.
Step 3: Data Preprocessing.
Step 4: Check the value count of fraud and legit transaction.
Step 5: Checking the number of missing values in each column.
Step 6: Distribution of legit transactions & fraudulent transactions: This Dataset is highly unblanced, 0 --> Normal Transaction 1 --> fraudulent transaction.
Step 7: Split the data into Training data & Testing Data.
Step 8: training the Logistic Regression Model with Training Data & Test Data.
Step 9: Last step is to findAccuracy Score, Accuracy on training data & Accuracy on test data.
